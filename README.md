## Overview
This repository contains the code, data(?) and documentation progress for my master thesis in the faculty for Psychological Methods with Interdisciplinary Focus.
Aim of the master thesis is to use different `features`as a predictor for emotion variables (Arousal,Dominance,Valence). The results will be compared between and within each feature. The within comparism will be between different classification techniques. Most likely, wether a traditional algorithm like the `Logistic Regression` or the `Support Vector Machine` provides comparable results to a `Neural Network`.

All operations are executed with python.

## Structure
The [open-lab-notebook](https://github.com/JNPauli/Protect_app_master_thesis/tree/main/open-lab-notebook) holds information about the process of generating the research question.

The [data folder](https://github.com/JNPauli/Protect_app_master_thesis/tree/main/data) holds the Dataset Exploration notebook. The code on how to load and process the data is stored in there. The Deep_Classification notebook is also hosted on [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kryYK0KILHHfUcC4Jj6U70wLl2dnkfFW?usp=sharing)
