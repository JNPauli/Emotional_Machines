## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation progress for my master thesis in the faculty for Psychological Methods with Interdisciplinary Focus.
Goal of the Master Thesis was to train a Convolutional Neural Network with Saliency Maps created by following the approach of [Simonyane et al., 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6034) and classify three emotion variables Valence, Arousal and Dominance, see [PAD-Theory](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02686918)


## Structure
The [open-lab-notebook](https://github.com/JNPauli/Protect_app_master_thesis/tree/main/open-lab-notebook) holds information about the process of generating the research question.

The [data folder](https://github.com/JNPauli/Protect_app_master_thesis/tree/main/data) holds the Dataset Exploration notebook. The code on how to load and process the data is stored in there. The Deep_Classification notebook is also hosted on [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kryYK0KILHHfUcC4Jj6U70wLl2dnkfFW?usp=sharing)

## Appendix
Please note that this project was conducted by a single person with only a bit of training in deep learning. My intrinsic goal was to improve my skillset and knowledge in deep learning.
