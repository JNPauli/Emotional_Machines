## Overview
This repository contains the code, data(?) and documentation progress for my master thesis in the faculty for Psychological Methods with Interdisciplinary Focus.
Aim of the master thesis is to compare the variability for the assessment of emotional valence in images between machine learning algorithms and human ratings.

## Structure
For now only the [open-lab-notebook](https://github.com/JNPauli/Protect_app_master_thesis/tree/main/open-lab-notebook) is filled with information, as the data and code folder have no content yet.
